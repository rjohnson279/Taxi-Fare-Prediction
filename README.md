# Final Project-DSCI 617

You are just hired as a Sr. Data Scientist at City of Chicago. You manager, mayor, Mr. 
Emanuel, asked you to download the dataset from  https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-taxi-rides-2016. 

It is a very large dataset containing about 20 million records. This dataset includes taxi 
trips for 2016, reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To 
protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given 
taxi medallion number but does not show the number, Census Tracts are suppressed in 
some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Due to the data reporting 
process, not all trips are reported but the City believes that most are.

was created.
